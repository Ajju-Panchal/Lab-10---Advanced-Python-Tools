# Lab-10---Advanced-Python-Tools

In this project, we will explore advanced Python tools for machine learning and AI

We are exploring Python tools on below two datasets:
1) Real World Smartphone dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhijitdahatonde/real-world-smartphones-dataset
2) Eligibility Prediction for Loan: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/eligibility-prediction-for-loan

I have created two jupyter notebook files for both the dataset

I performed below tasks on above datasets:

Task 1: Dataset Selection
  a. Choose two datasets from the provided repositories.
  b. Justify your selection for each dataset based on its relevance to
  machine learning tasks. Include a brief paragraph explaining the
  dataset's potential for analysis and its suitability for machine
  learning applications.
Task 2: Data Exploration with Python
  a. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python for the first
  dataset.
  b. Generate summary statistics, identify data types, and visualize
  the data distribution to gain insights into the dataset.
Task 3: Data Preprocessing with Python
  a. Preprocess the data from the first dataset using Python.
  b. Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering
  when necessary to prepare the data for machine learning
  models.
Task 4: Implement Machine Learning Models with Python
  a. Implement at least two different machine learning models (e.g.,
  SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network) for the first dataset using
  Python.
  b. Evaluate and compare the performance of each model using
  appropriate metrics to determine the most suitable model for the
  dataset.
Task 5: Visualization with Python
  a. Create meaningful visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps,
  bar charts) for the first dataset using Python.
  b. Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create clear and
  insightful visual representations of the dataset.
Task 6: Documentation for Python Code
  a. Provide detailed explanations and comments for each step of the
  analysis in the Python notebooks for the first dataset.
  b . Ensure the Python code is well-structured, easy to read, and
  includes comments that explain the purpose and functionality of
  each code block.
